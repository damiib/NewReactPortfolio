  <h1>About Damali</h1>
  <p> Hello World! Thank you for visiting my site. My name is Damali. I am a newbie to web development who loves learning about code. I am
    sharing my class work with you. I am so grateful to be learning coding I want to be successful at this and grow in
    this market.  I have had a lot of fun learning from my coding teacher, the school faculty and my fellow students.  I am glad that I stuck through the difficult times and push myself to understand code more.</p>
    <br>
    </br>
    <p>This has not been an easy class for me. I am trying everyday to be better at this. I think it is important to
    understand the work that you are doing rather than how it looks. First, learn why you are using a certain if
    statment or function. If you do not understand the code, do not write it until you understand it. Once you understand the code,
    then you should focus on the design. I am being patient with myself because there is a lot of information to be
    have to absorbed. My work is not perfect, but it will eventually get better. I thank you for visiting my site and I
    am looking forward to everyone visting my site again.
